What's the difference between a successful corporate and a start up. 

The corporate has proven that it has survived the early phases and was already able to scale one or more products. And mostly because of the size and the entry barriers in markets with scaled products they know there competitors relatively good and have a running business.

Startups on the other hand work work in the early phases. They have not seldom to transform several times up to the point they get their first product/service into the market and to the customers.

As a metaphor you can refer corporates as tankers and startups as speedboats. But because you see many good examples of growing startups which have emerged from a speedboat to a tanker in only a short period of time. Like some of the companies with the currently highest strock market rating. (Google, Facebook,...) Most of those companies did not exist 30 years ago. 

Because markets change faster and faster and innovation cycles get shorter also big corporates have to permanently transform to keep up with the pace of the markets.

Startups mainly grow exponentially if they have disruptive innovations. So big corporates try to create disruptive innovations in parallel to their existing business. But is this really feasible with their current structures. Is it also possible to copy the structures of the startup companies with trips to the silicon valley?

I think the main challenge is to get those to opposite mindset into the same company. On the one hand the currently working business model which scales really well for current products to improve them. Those are at corporates mostly KPI driven. 

But then the challenge is how to adapt to the `rising stars` of startups. In comparison to corporates which focus on `competitor analysis`, `customer relationships`, `product features` and `cost reduction` startups mainly focus on `minimal viable products` with short `time to market` cycles. 
If you compare the output products from corporates which mostly solve multiple problems at once and have a lot of features. Products from startups mainly focus on one single problem to solve.

There you find a part of the difference. Startups mainly focus on a problem. Whereas corporates often mostly focus on the solution. Thats because that if there is already a solution which `only` needs to be optimized you can easily create KPI's to measure the success in the process. 

The big challenge will be now how to separate those disruptive ideas which are not easily measurable from the KPI-driven developments in existing business fields.

Those corporates which are steadily able to transform through creating enough `speedboats` (disruptive innovations) and more important to develop them to `tankers` to compensate the amount of revenue which is lost through changing markets will survive.
