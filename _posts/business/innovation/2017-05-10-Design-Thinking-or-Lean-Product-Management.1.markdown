There are many buzzwords currently hyped. Two of them are `Design Thinking`and `Lean Product Management` as well as `User Experience UX`.

Is it all the same? 

All of them have in common that they put the customer/user in the center of developing new products or services.

Both of them have in common that the development team opens as early as possible to its (potential) customers.

The difference between those two is that `Design Thinking focuses` on finding unmet customer/user needs and then developing a product to fit the customer needs. Whereas `Lean Start Up` has already a hypothesis which problem should be solved with the target to get to the market as fast as possible.

But there is already a new star rising at the buzzword sky. It is `The Design Sprint` developed by `Google Ventures`.  
It is the try to get the whole process of finding what to develop into a workshop/sprint of one week. It is an interessing approach how to find a businessmodel or the real customer need in one week. 

A short checklist you find below at the link from `Google Ventures`.
